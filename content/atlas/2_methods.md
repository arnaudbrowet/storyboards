## EUCP has led underlying work to understand user value in these approaches

The work within EUCP has been on understanding different potential quantitative approaches to using historical validation of current projections.  We provided the first common evaluation of their projected changes, across a range of currently available methodologies. 

We have assessed the reliability of these approaches using blind out-of-sample evaluation, using new CMIP6 simulations as a proxy for real world historical and future responses.  This has enabled us to look at the skill of each method across a range of metrics, which provides an objective assessment of a particular methodological approach.
