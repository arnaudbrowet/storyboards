## Assessing the value added

An important output from our EUCP work has been to develop an objective assessment of the value added by using a methodology that uses observations to validate projections. We coordinated a blind common out-of-sample assessment of each methodâ€™s skill, using new CMIP6 simulations as pseudo-observations and then validated the constrained projections using the future CMIP6 responses.

This is a tough test of the methods as CMIP6 includes process not represented in earlier climate projection and includes some projected changes that lie outside this range. This enabled us to assess to identified where these methods provided more reliable estimates than just taking the raw climate model range.

We have been able to summarise the implied skill of each method. Based on this
out-of-sample analysis, we find that:

* Use of observations leads to improved temperature projections for all methods
* However, little evidence of consistent skill for rainfall

These results also point to where using a particular methodology can actually make the results worse than just using the CMIP spread. Rainfall projections are worse using ASK, whereas CALL showed poor results in the Mediterranean for temperature. These issues relate to the particular properties of the methodologies that make them more or less suitable for some applications.

The summary of the out-of-sample assessment, presented here, provides a guide to where applying one of these methodologies is likely to add value.
