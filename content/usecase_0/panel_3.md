headline: How we applied the method
---

We used a [cluster method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis#Density-based_clustering) to group similar data points together.

This allowed us to reduce the data to a more manageable volume.

Subsequently, we applied [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression). For this use case, it was not necessary to use more complex curve fitting algorithms, because it is only an example. For other use cases, a guidance document to help choose the best approach is [available online]()

Source code to reproduce this method is [available as well](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html)
